Started learning Kubernetes today. Here's the setup I did to start learning.

**My Local Kubernetes Environment:**

I configured a complete local Kubernetes environment on Arch Linux:

1. Installed Rancher Desktop for local K8s cluster management
2. Set up kubectl for command-line cluster interaction
3. Configured k9s for interactive terminal-based cluster management
4. Updated bash completion to the correct Arch Linux path
5. Customized vim configuration for YAML and Kubernetes files

**Why this setup matters:**

✅ Complete local Kubernetes cluster with zero cloud costs
✅ Fast iteration and hands-on learning environment
✅ Practice real-world configurations before production
✅ Full control over my development environment

The best part? Having a local cluster means I can break things, experiment freely, and learn by doing without worrying about costs or breaking production systems.

Can't wait to go deep into Kubernetes and master container orchestration.
