Started learning Kubernetes today. Here's my local dev setup on Arch Linux:

- Rancher Desktop for local K8s cluster
- kubectl for CLI management
- k9s for interactive cluster UI
- Custom vim config for YAML files

Having a local cluster means I can break things and learn freely without cloud costs.

Can't wait to go deep into container orchestration.

What's your Kubernetes learning setup?
