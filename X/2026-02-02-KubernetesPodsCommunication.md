Docker networking: manually create bridge networks, connect containers with --network flags, manage everything yourself.

Kubernetes networking: every pod gets an IP automatically. Cluster-wide flat network. Communication just works.

This is what elegant infrastructure looks like. 🧵

I exec'd into an httpd pod and curled an nginx pod using its IP.

No network setup. No configuration. It just worked across the entire cluster.

The best platforms make entire categories of complexity disappear.

Moving from Docker to Kubernetes? This automatic networking is one of those "aha moments."
